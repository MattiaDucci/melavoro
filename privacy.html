    <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information:</h2>
    <p>Kryax SRL does not collect personal information on our Site or Apps. However, Kryax SRL uses Apple Inc.&rsquo;s billing software to process purchases of, and sometimes paid subscriptions to, Kryax SRL Apps made through the iTunes Store.

    <h2>Security:</h2>
    <p>While we take all necessary measures to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is fully secure, therefore we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
